Ready to have fun with functions, matrices, random sampling, and more? If so, get ready to simulate your own Boggle board in R! (For those of you who are unfamiliar with Boggle checkout this link: [Wordshake Boggle](https://wordshake.com/boggle))

If you want to take a stab at this on your own before following along, here some general guidelines:
1. Write a function to return a random Boggle board in a 4x4 matrix.
2. Create 16 unique dice - each a list with 6 letters.
3. When the function is run, randomize the placement of each die in the matrix and the side that the die lands on.

For those of you following along, I will guide you step-by-step, explaining the concepts as I go.

## Creating 16 dice
As you know, to play Boggle you need 16, six-sided dice, where each side has a letter printed on it. To make a die in R, we are going to create a vector that contains six different letters:

```r
die <- c("F", "Y", "N", "I", "S", "W")
```

Because we need 16 total, and the process to write all of them out might get tedious, feel free to copy and paste the code for all 16 dice below:

```r
d1 = c('S','R','E','L','A','C')
d2 = c('D','P','A','C','E','M')
d3 = c('Qu','B','A','O','J','M')
d4 = c('D','U','T','O','K','N')
d5 = c('O','M','H ','R','S','A')
d6 = c('E','I','F','E','H','Y')
d7 = c('B','R','I','F','O','X')
d8 = c('R','L','U','W','I','G')
d9 = c('N','S','O','W','E','D')
d10 = c('Y ','L','I','B','A','T')
d11 = c('T','N','I','G','E','V')
d12 = c('T','A','C','I','T','O')
d13 = c('P','S','U','T','E','L')
d14 = c('E','P','I','S','H ','N')
d15 = c('Y','K','U','L','E','G')
d16 = c('N','Z','E','V','A','D')
```

## Storing the dice in a matrix
In order to most efficiently store each die and be able to randomize their placement and face, we will place each in its own column of a matrix. As shown below, we can do this by passing a vector of all of the dice into the ```matrix()``` function and then specify with "ncol" that we want 16 columns. As there are only 16 elements in the vector passed in, each element or dice will get its own column.

```r
  dice <- matrix(c(d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, 
                  d9, d10, d11, d12, d13, d14, d15, d16),
                ncol = 16)
```
If we call ```dice```, we can see that we created a matrix where each column contains the elements or letters of that numbered die.
```r
dice
```
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14] [,15] [,16]
[1,] "S"  "D"  "Qu" "D"  "O"  "E"  "B"  "R"  "N"  "Y "  "T"   "T"   "P"   "E"   "Y"   "N"  
[2,] "R"  "P"  "B"  "U"  "M"  "I"  "R"  "L"  "S"  "L"   "N"   "A"   "S"   "P"   "K"   "Z"  
[3,] "E"  "A"  "A"  "T"  "H " "F"  "I"  "U"  "O"  "I"   "I"   "C"   "U"   "I"   "U"   "E"  
[4,] "L"  "C"  "O"  "O"  "R"  "E"  "F"  "W"  "W"  "B"   "G"   "I"   "T"   "S"   "L"   "V"  
[5,] "A"  "E"  "J"  "K"  "S"  "H"  "O"  "I"  "E"  "A"   "E"   "T"   "E"   "H "  "E"   "A"  
[6,] "C"  "M"  "M"  "N"  "A"  "Y"  "X"  "G"  "D"  "T"   "V"   "O"   "L"   "N"   "G"   "D"  
```

## Rolling the dice
In Boggle, when the dice are rolled, two random events occur for each die. First, the die lands on a random face (roll). Second, the die lands in a random slot in the 4x4 matrix (placement). 

### Randomizing the roll
To randomize which face each die lands on, we will use the function ```apply()``` which applies a user-specified function to the marginal values of matrix (either the rows(1) or columns(2)). In this case, we are applying the function ```sample()``` to the 16 columns of the matrix ```dice```. The ```sample()``` function tells R to randomly select a sample of size one (so one letter) in this case from the element specificed - a dice. Lastly, we will save this output as a vector called faces. 
```r
faces <- apply(dice, 2, sample, size = 1)
```
If we take a peek at ```faces```, you should see a randomly generated vector of letters, one from each die.
``` r
faces
```
``` 
[1] "S" "A" "O" "O" "A" "H" "X" "I" "W" "A" "V" "I" "L" "P" "K" "A"
```

### Randomizing the placement
Now, the last task left is to randomly assign each face of the dice generated above to a location in our 4x4 Boggle board. To do this, we can once again use the ```sample()``` function, but because our sample size is 16 and the length of our vector ```faces``` is also 16, all this will do is randomize the order of its elements. Once the order is randomized, we can then store it in a matrix called ```board``` (our Boggle board!) which has four rows and four columns.
```r
board <- matrix(sample(faces, size = 16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
```
Looking at the output of board, we see that indeed, the order of ```faces``` was randomized and we finally have the letters (one from each die) in a 4x4 Boggle board!
```r
board
```
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,] "A"  "I"  "O"  "W" 
[2,] "S"  "H"  "K"  "A" 
[3,] "V"  "O"  "A"  "A" 
[4,] "I"  "L"  "X"  "P" 
```

## Finishing touches
Now that we have all of the code to make our Boggle board, we are just about finished! The last coding step is to create a function called ```get_board()``` inside of which we will stick all of our code up until this point. Your function should look like the one below:

```r
get_board <- function(){
  d1 = c('S','R','E','L','A','C')
  d2 = c('D','P','A','C','E','M')
  d3 = c('Qu','B','A','O','J','M')
  d4 = c('D','U','T','O','K','N')
  d5 = c('O','M','H ','R','S','A')
  d6 = c('E','I','F','E','H','Y')
  d7 = c('B','R','I','F','O','X')
  d8 = c('R','L','U','W','I','G')
  d9 = c('N','S','O','W','E','D')
  d10 = c('Y ','L','I','B','A','T')
  d11 = c('T','N','I','G','E','V')
  d12 = c('T','A','C','I','T','O')
  d13 = c('P','S','U','T','E','L')
  d14 = c('E','P','I','S','H ','N')
  d15 = c('Y','K','U','L','E','G')
  d16 = c('N','Z','E','V','A','D')
  
  dice <- matrix(c(d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,
                  d9,d10,d11,d12,d13,d14,d15,d16),
                ncol = 16) # putting each die into a separate column in the matrix
  
  faces <- apply(dice, 2, sample, size = 1) # 1st randomization (roll)
  
  board <- matrix(sample(faces, size = 16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4) # 2nd randomization (placement)

  return(board)
}
```
Now, when we call the function, we should get a randomly generated Boggle board like this!

```r
get_board()
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,] "Qu" "L"  "U"  "H "
[2,] "F"  "L"  "E"  "E" 
[3,] "S"  "F"  "E"  "V" 
[4,] "I"  "N"  "T"  "T" 
```
