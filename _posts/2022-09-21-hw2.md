Ready to have fun with functions, matrices, and random sampling? If so, get ready to simulate your own boggle board in R! (For those of you who are unfamiliar with boggle checkout this link: [Wordshake Boggle](https://wordshake.com/boggle))

If you want to take a stab at this on your own before following along, here some general guidelines:
1. Write a function to return a random boggle board in a 4x4 matrix.
2. Create 16 unique dice - each a list with 6 letters.
3. When the function is run, randomize the placement of each die in the matrix and the side that the die lands on.

For those of you following along, I will guide you step-by-step, explaining the concepts as I go 

*Note: I have insufficient space to cover each concept fully and will only go over what is needed in this example. However, I have included helpful links which explore each topic in more depth.*

## Write the function get_board()

The very first step is to define our function. For those who are confident in functions, feel free to skip the following section.

### A Brief Overview of Functions
A function is basically an object that stores code that can can be run simply by calling that object. Functions are mainly used to automatate common tasks to avoid copying and pasting code.

The general structure of a function is as follows:
* Name  
* Set of arguments (optional)  
* Chunk of code  
* Value to return

Putting all of these parts together gives the general syntax for a function in R. By default, R will indent the code inside the curly braces to improve readability.
```r
function_name <- function(argument_1, argument_2) {
    #insert code chunk here
    return(return_value)
}
```

Below is an example of a simple function ```addition()``` which takes as arguments two integers, x and y, and outputs their sum:

```r
addition <- function(x, y) {
    return_value <- x + y
    return(return_value)
}

addition(3, 6)
```
```
[1] 9
```

### Boggle Application
For our purposes, we will create a function called ```get_board()``` inside of which we will write the code that will generate our boggle board.

Following the format above, we will write:  
```r
get_board() <- function() {  
  
}
```

As you probably noticed, there are no arguments passed to the function. This is simply because, compared to the ```addition()``` function in the example above, we do not need any parameters to be able to generate the output - a boggle board.

## Creating 16 dice
As you know, to play boggle you need 16, six-sided dice, where each side has a letter printed on it. To make a die in R, we are going to create a vector that contained six different letters.

### A Brief Overview of Vector
For our purposes, a vector is any object created with the function ```c()``` and any singular object with length one. All values in a vector must be of the same data type.

```r
my_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

my_vector
```

```
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
```

So, to create a six-sided letter die, we can do the following:

```r
die <- c("F", "Y", "N", "I", "S", "W")
```

Because we need 16 total, and the process to write all of them out might get tedious, feel free to copy and paste the code for all 16 dice below:

```r
d1 = c('S','R','E','L','A','C')
d2 = c('D','P','A','C','E','M')
d3 = c('Qu','B','A','O','J','M')
d4 = c('D','U','T','O','K','N')
d5 = c('O','M','H ','R','S','A')
d6 = c('E','I','F','E','H','Y')
d7 = c('B','R','I','F','O','X')
d8 = c('R','L','U','W','I','G')
d9 = c('N','S','O','W','E','D')
d10 = c('Y ','L','I','B','A','T')
d11 = c('T','N','I','G','E','V')
d12 = c('T','A','C','I','T','O')
d13 = c('P','S','U','T','E','L')
d14 = c('E','P','I','S','H ','N')
d15 = c('Y','K','U','L','E','G')
d16 = c('N','Z','E','V','A','D')
```

## Storing the dice in a matrix
In order to most efficiently store each die and be able to randomize their placement and face, we will place each in its own column of a matrix.

```r
  dice <- matrix(c(d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8, 
                  d9, d10, d11, d12, d13, d14, d15, d16),
                ncol = 16)
```

## Rolling the dice
In boggle, when the dice are rolled, two random events occur for each die. First, the die lands on a random face (roll). Second, the die lands in a random slot in the 4x4 matrix (placement). 

### Randomizing the roll

```r
faces <- apply(dice, 2, sample, size = 1)
```

### Randomizing the placement

```r
board <- matrix(sample(faces, size = 16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)
```

## Returning the board
Here is where we get to put all of the code together and finally see the Boggle board we first set out to make!

```r
get_board <- function(){
  d1 = c('S','R','E','L','A','C')
  d2 = c('D','P','A','C','E','M')
  d3 = c('Qu','B','A','O','J','M')
  d4 = c('D','U','T','O','K','N')
  d5 = c('O','M','H ','R','S','A')
  d6 = c('E','I','F','E','H','Y')
  d7 = c('B','R','I','F','O','X')
  d8 = c('R','L','U','W','I','G')
  d9 = c('N','S','O','W','E','D')
  d10 = c('Y ','L','I','B','A','T')
  d11 = c('T','N','I','G','E','V')
  d12 = c('T','A','C','I','T','O')
  d13 = c('P','S','U','T','E','L')
  d14 = c('E','P','I','S','H ','N')
  d15 = c('Y','K','U','L','E','G')
  d16 = c('N','Z','E','V','A','D')
  
  dice <- matrix(c(d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,
                  d9,d10,d11,d12,d13,d14,d15,d16),
                ncol = 16) # putting each die into a separate column in the matrix
  
  faces <- apply(dice, 2, sample, size = 1) # 1st randomization (roll)
  
  board <- matrix(sample(faces, size = 16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4) # 2nd randomization (placement)

  return(board)
}
```
Now, when we call the function, we should get a randomly generated Boggle board like this!

```r
get_board()
```

```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,] "Qu" "L"  "U"  "H "
[2,] "F"  "L"  "E"  "E" 
[3,] "S"  "F"  "E"  "V" 
[4,] "I"  "N"  "T"  "T" 
```
