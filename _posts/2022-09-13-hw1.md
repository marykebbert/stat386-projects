# Why Regression?
Installing windmills can be a risky endeavor. In order to produce enough energy to compensate for the hefty installation price, there must be adequate wind at the site.<break>
One potential method of determining the right windmill sites is to use wind speed data that has been collected at nearby sites, called "reference sites". In this post, we will go over how to use simple linear regression to determine if and how we can use the wind speed data at these reference sites to predict the wind speeds at the candidate sites (where we want to install the windmills).
# Getting set-up
To follow along you will need access to:
1. The data set: windmill.txt
2. RStudio
<break>
These are the steps we will follow:
1. Load the data set in R
2. Plot the data
3. Check assumptions
4. Make predictions
5. Perform linear regression calculations
6. Propose a model
7. Make a conclusion

# 1) Load the data set in R

etc...
