If you've followed this project day one, you know that I started by asking myself, how has Taylor Swift's popularity evolved over the years?  
Growing up I had heard about Taylor Swift, known that she was a country/pop star, and very famous. However, I never really listened to her music until my husband introdced it to me. I have found memories of long drives, homework sessions, and impromptu dances we shared while listening to our favorite songs of hers. In many ways, I am just barely a Swiftie. However, ever since the smashing success of her newly released album, "Midnights" and the almost instant sell-out of the tickets to her Eras concert, I have been curious about how her popularity has changed over the years. Up until recently, I had not followed her career very closely, but in the short time I have got to know her music I feel that I have been watching unpredented developments in her career. In other words, I wanted to see how her popularity has changed over the years and how this past year compares to the other 15 years in her career.

This question has taken me many different places. I initially wanted to use Spotify's API to find the success of her albums and songs over the years, and take advantage of the special track features it offers to see how her music may have changed. However, after retrieving the data, I realized that there was simply not enough data for me to really see the progression of her career. 

Next, I turned to the Billboard Hot 100. I thought by looking at how well her tracks have done over the years would help me solve this question. In many ways it did. In my last post, I found her most popular songs and got an idea of how well each album performed. However, after hours of trying to make this data more presentable, I realized that the simplest way to find the answer to my question would be to use a different Billboard, the Billboard 200. This ranks the top 200 albums every week. Almost immediately after retriving this data, I plotted a simple line graph, and volia! It was very messy but it contained the data I was looking for! By plotting this as shown below, I could finally see the performance of her albums over the years.  (note: I wanted to use the Artist 100 Billboard, but this only started in 2014? and thus did not go back far enough for my needs) 

Below is my final graph!
Stay tuned for an interactive dashboard!
